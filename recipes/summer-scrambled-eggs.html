    <h1>Chef John's summer scrambled eggs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>cooking isn't always about doing the right thing, this scrambled egg is the perfect example. Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a
        scramble tastes great, but its not common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; 
        I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese fore this; it's awesome!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Large eggs</li>
        <li>1 Pinch red pepper flake</li>
        <li>9 Cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>O Live oil</li>
        <li>1 Pinch of sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir tomatoes, feta, and basil leaves into egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until oil starts to shimmer.

        <li>Cook and stir egg mixture until eggs are scrambled and softly set, about 30 seconds.
