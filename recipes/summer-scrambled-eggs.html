    <h1>Chef John's summer scrambled eggs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>cooking isn't always about doing the right thing, this scrambled egg is the perfect example. Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a
        scramble tastes great, but its not common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; 
        I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese fore this; it's awesome!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>3 Large eggs</li>
