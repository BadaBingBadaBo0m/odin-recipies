    <p>
        Decadent? Yes! Sweet? Yes! Tasty? Yes! I just whipped this up this morning. I love things lemon, and it has to be sweet. 
        None of that tartness, no thank you. This is something fun to make Sunday morning. 
        Some kids may not like the lemon flavoring, but the sweetness may be an attraction.
